# Project Murals

### Notes
@TheoVoss from Slack

All the data is stored here: https://localwiki.org/gr/tags/mural

[7:56]
I have 2 things for each mural: a picture and the gps location of it.

[7:57]
eventually I’d like to get this level of detail for most of the murals: https://localwiki.org/toledo/Toledo_Loves_Love

[7:57]
(someone in Toledo put that one together)

[7:58]
So my UI is currently localwiki, but localwiki isn’t a great way to just browse them.

[7:59]
One thing I do want to do once I get some of the historical data on each would be to put together a walking tour of murals. Maybe all ones sponsored by UICA, or ones that appeared in artprize, or ect...

[8:00]
Basically: I’m open to suggestions for UI.
